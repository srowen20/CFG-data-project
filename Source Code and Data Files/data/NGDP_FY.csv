The 2021 Fiscal Plan calls for a series of structural reforms, such as Earned Income Tax Credit benefits and Natural Assistance Program (NAP), lowering barriers to entry for foreign firms, investment in education, power sector, and infrastructure. The new fiscal plan also pays particular attention at allocating strategic investment to emergency response and frontline service delivery, as the island is highly vulnerable to  natural disasters and battling an ongoing pandemic. This plan represents an unprecedented level of fiscal support - over 100% of Puerto Rico's national gross product. The Fiscal Plan finally focuses on the implementation of fiscal measures (centralizing fiscal authority, agencies efficiency, Medicaid reform, pension reform, reduction of appropriations, enhanced tax compliance and optimized taxes and fees) that would result in a smaller government deficit in the long term. IMF fiscal projections rely on the  information presented above, as well as on the assumption that the fiscal position will deteriorate over time. Previous WEO submissions (prior to Fall 2021), on the other hand,  relied on the assumption of fiscal consolidation. Although IMF policy assumptions are similar to those in the FEGP scenario with full measures, the IMF's projections of fiscal revenues, expenditures, and balance are different from the FEGPs'. This stems from two main differences in methodologies: first, while IMF projections are on an accrual basis, the FEGPs' are on a cash basis. Second, the IMF and FEGPs make very different macroeconomic assumptions.

In addition, pension funds (ERS, TRS, and JRS) are also considered as part of general government. Valuation of public debt: Current market value.

These funds are recorded as revenues, consistent with IMF's methodology. Therefore, data and projections for 2018 - 2021 are affected by these transfers, which amounted to 1.2 percent of GDP in 2018, 1.1 percent of GDP in 2019, 0.6 percent of GDP in 2020, and are projected to be 0.3 percent of GDP in 2021 and zero percent thereafter.

The coverage of the fiscal data was changed from consolidated public sector to nonfinancial public sector (NFPS) with the October 2019 submission. In Uruguay, NFPS coverage includes Central Government, Local Government, Social Security Funds, Nonfinancial Public Corporations, and Banco de Seguros del Estado. Historical data was revised accordingly. Under this narrower fiscal perimeter assets and liabilities held by the NFPS where the counterpart is the central bank are not netted out in debt figures. In this context, capitalization bonds issued in the past by the government to the central bank are now part of the NFPS debt. Gross and net debt estimates for the period 2008-2011 are preliminary.
