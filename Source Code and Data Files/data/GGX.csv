Projections assume that the measures taken in response to the coronavirus outbreak expire as announced. It is also assumed there is some additional fiscal consolidation relative to the policies announced to date starting in FY2023/24 with the goal of stabilizing public debt within five years. The IMF staff's data exclude public sector banks and the effect of transferring assets from the Royal Mail Pension Plan to the public sector in April 2012.
