8365,112,GBR,GGXWDG,United Kingdom,General government gross debt,"Gross debt consists of all liabilities that require payment or payments of interest and/or principal by the debtor to the creditor at a date or dates in the future. This includes debt liabilities in the form of SDRs, currency and deposits, debt securities, loans, insurance, pensions and standardized guarantee schemes, and other accounts payable. Thus, all liabilities in the GFSM 2001 system are debt, except for equity and investment fund shares and financial derivatives and employee stock options. Debt can be valued at current market, nominal, or face values (GFSM 2001, paragraph 7.110).",National currency,Billions,"Source: National Statistics Office. Data takes into account statistical revisions (including on student loans accounting) implemented on September 24, 2019, and revisions to historical data released on December 22, 2020. Latest actual data: 2020 Notes: Note the general government variables exclude the temporary effects of financial interventions. Fiscal assumptions: Fiscal projections are based on the latest GDP data published by the Office of National Statistics on February 12, 2021, and forecasts by the Office for Budget Responsibility from November 23, 2020. Revenue projections are adjusted for differences between the IMF staff's forecasts of macroeconomic variables (such as GDP growth and inflation) and the forecasts of these variables assumed in the authorities' fiscal projections. Projections assume that the measures taken in response to the coronavirus outbreak expire as announced. It is also assumed there is some additional fiscal consolidation relative to the policies announced to date starting in FY2023/24 with the goal of stabilizing public debt within five years. The IMF staff's data exclude public sector banks and the effect of transferring assets from the Royal Mail Pension Plan to the public sector in April 2012. Real government consumption and investment are part of the real GDP path, which, according to the IMF staff, may or may not be the same as projected by the UK Office for Budget Responsibility.
