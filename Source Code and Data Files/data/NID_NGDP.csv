The change also includes methodological changes (for example, direct estimation of private consumption based on a survey) and most important, change in the index formulae (historically a Laspeyres fixed-base index and now a Laspeyres chain index).

Preliminary numbers Notes: Real GDP data for the period 1990-2009 have been adjusted by desk economist to account for breaks in the source data. The breaks are associated with changes in the base year from 1984 to 1995, to 2000, and subsequently to 2010. Pre-revision data exist for the period prior to 1995. The nominal data were revised back to 1995. The latest revision of nominal and real data go to 2010. Using the pre-revision data, desk economist recalculated the constant price data for the period prior to 1995 so that y-o-y change of each component remains unchanged. A similar adjustment was made to the period 1995-2009.
