A consumer price index (CPI) measures changes in the prices of goods and services that households consume. Such changes affect the real purchasing power of consumers' incomes and their welfare. As the prices of different goods and services do not all change at the same rate, a price index can only reflect their average movement. A price index is typically assigned a value of unity, or 100, in some reference period and the values of the index for other periods of time are intended to indicate the average proportionate, or percentage, change in prices from this price reference period. Price indices can also be used to measure differences in price levels between different cities, regions or countries at the same point in time. [CPI Manual 2004, Introduction] For euro countries, consumer prices are calculated based on harmonized prices.

6318,359,PRI,PCPIE,Puerto Rico,"Inflation, end of period consumer prices","Expressed in end of the period, not annual average data. A consumer price index (CPI) measures changes in the prices of goods and services that households consume. Such changes affect the real purchasing power of consumers' incomes and their welfare. As the prices of different goods and services do not all change at the same rate, a price index can only reflect their average movement. A price index is typically assigned a value of unity, or 100, in some reference period and the values of the index for other periods of time are intended to indicate the average proportionate, or percentage, change in prices from this price reference period. Price indices can also be used to measure differences in price levels between different cities, regions or countries at the same point in time. [CPI Manual 2004, Introduction] For euro countries, consumer prices are calculated based on harmonized prices.

The 2021 Fiscal Plan calls for a series of structural reforms, such as Earned Income Tax Credit benefits and Natural Assistance Program (NAP), lowering barriers to entry for foreign firms, investment in education, power sector, and infrastructure. The new fiscal plan also pays particular attention at allocating strategic investment to emergency response and frontline service delivery, as the island is highly vulnerable to  natural disasters and battling an ongoing pandemic. This plan represents an unprecedented level of fiscal support - over 100% of Puerto Rico's national gross product. The Fiscal Plan finally focuses on the implementation of fiscal measures (centralizing fiscal authority, agencies efficiency, Medicaid reform, pension reform, reduction of appropriations, enhanced tax compliance and optimized taxes and fees) that would result in a smaller government deficit in the long term. IMF fiscal projections rely on the  information presented above, as well as on the assumption that the fiscal position will deteriorate over time. Previous WEO submissions (prior to Fall 2021), on the other hand,  relied on the assumption of fiscal consolidation. Although IMF policy assumptions are similar to those in the FEGP scenario with full measures, the IMF's projections of fiscal revenues, expenditures, and balance are different from the FEGPs'. This stems from two main differences in methodologies: first, while IMF projections are on an accrual basis, the FEGPs' are on a cash basis. Second, the IMF and FEGPs make very different macroeconomic assumptions.
