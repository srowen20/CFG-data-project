6811,718,SYC,PCPI,Seychelles,"Inflation, average consumer prices","Expressed in averages for the year, not end-of-period data. A consumer price index (CPI) measures changes in the prices of goods and services that households consume. Such changes affect the real purchasing power of consumers' incomes and their welfare. As the prices of different goods and services do not all change at the same rate, a price index can only reflect their average movement. A price index is typically assigned a value of unity, or 100, in some reference period and the values of the index for other periods of time are intended to indicate the average proportionate, or percentage, change in prices from this price reference period. Price indices can also be used to measure differences in price levels between different cities, regions or countries at the same point in time. [CPI Manual 2004, Introduction] For euro countries, consumer prices are calculated based on harmonized prices.

New weights , a new product basket, an expanded price collection were introduced based on 2018/2019 Household Budget Survey for the CPI starting in Jan.2021.The index reference period for the new CPI index series is therefore 2020=100. Starting with theindex for January 2021, only the new CPI index series will be calculated.To enable a long run CPI index series to be published. The new CPI index (2020=100) must belinked to the current CPI index series (2014=100), this requires the new index series to be rescaledto the level of the last monthly index of the current CPI index series i.e., December 2020. Startingwith the index for January 2021, this is achieved by multiplying each month's index of the newupdated CPI series by the December 2020 index of the current CPI index series 2014, then dividingby 100.
